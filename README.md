# Postgres-to-R2 Backup (S3-Compatible)

A lightweight PostgreSQL backup automation tool that creates scheduled backups and securely uploads them to **S3-compatible object storage**
such as **Cloudflare R2, AWS S3, Wasabi, Backblaze B2, or MinIO**.

It is designed to run reliably on **PaaS platforms**, with first-class support for Docker and cron scheduling, while remaining fully portable via a CLI or container.

---

## 🔧 Environment Variables (S3-Compatible)

```env
DATABASE_URL=           # PostgreSQL database URL (private)
DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL=    # Public PostgreSQL URL (optional)
USE_PUBLIC_URL=false    # Set true to use DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL

DUMP_FORMAT=dump        # sql | plain | dump | custom | tar
FILENAME_PREFIX=backup  # Backup filename prefix
MAX_BACKUPS=7           # Number of backups to retain
KEEP_LOCAL_BACKUP=false # Keep backup file locally after upload (not recommended on PaaS)

R2_ENDPOINT=            # S3 endpoint URL
R2_BUCKET_NAME=         # Bucket name
R2_ACCESS_KEY=          # Access key
R2_SECRET_KEY=          # Secret key
S3_REGION=us-east-1     # Required for AWS S3 (ignored by R2/MinIO)

RUN_ONCE=false          # Run once and exit instead of scheduler (set true for Railway Cron)
BACKUP_PASSWORD=        # Optional: enables 7z encryption
BACKUP_TIME=00:00       # Daily backup time (UTC, HH:MM)
```

> Variable names use `R2_*` for historical reasons, but **any S3-compatible provider** can be used by changing the endpoint and credentials.
> For AWS S3 users: ensure `S3_REGION` matches your bucket’s region.

- AWS S3
- Wasabi
- Backblaze B2 (S3 API)
- MinIO (self-hosted)

### Example Endpoints

| Provider | Endpoint Example |
|--------|------------------|
| Cloudflare R2 | `https://<accountid>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com` |
| AWS S3 | `https://s3.amazonaws.com` |
| Wasabi | `https://s3.wasabisys.com` |
| Backblaze B2 | `https://s3.us-west-004.backblazeb2.com` |
| MinIO | `http://localhost:9000` |

## ⏰ Railway Cron Jobs

You can configure the backup schedule using **Railway Cron Jobs**:

1. Open your Railway project  
2. Go to **Deployments → Cron**  
3. Add a cron job targeting this service  

### Common Cron Expressions

| Schedule | Cron Expression | Description |
|--------|----------------|------------|
| Hourly | `0 * * * *` | Every hour |
| Daily | `0 0 * * *` | Once per day (UTC midnight) |
| Twice Daily | `0 */12 * * *` | Every 12 hours |
| Weekly | `0 0 * * 0` | Every Sunday |
| Monthly | `0 0 1 * *` | First day of the month |

**Tips**
- All cron times are **UTC**
- Use https://crontab.guru to validate expressions
- Adjust `MAX_BACKUPS` to match your schedule

> If you use Railway Cron Jobs, the service will start once per execution.
> In this setup, the service is expected to run a single backup and exit. Any internal scheduler should not be relied on.
> Ensure the backup process exits cleanly after completion; otherwise, Railway will skip subsequent cron executions.

---

### 🔁 Cron Mode (Important)

When using Railway Cron Jobs, you must enable one-shot mode:

```env
RUN_ONCE=true
```

This ensures the service:

- runs a single backup  
- exits cleanly after completion  

If not set, the service will run continuously and future cron executions may be skipped.

> `BACKUP_TIME` is only used when `RUN_ONCE=false` (daemon mode).  
> When using Railway Cron (`RUN_ONCE=true`), scheduling is controlled by Railway.

---

## 🖥️ Running Locally or on Other Platforms

It can run on **any platform** that supports:
- Python 3.9+
- `pg_dump` (PostgreSQL client tools)
- Environment variables
- Long-running background processes or cron

> Docker images use **Python 3.12** by default.  
> Local execution supports **Python 3.9+**.

### Supported Environments

- Local machine (Linux / macOS / Windows*)
- VPS (Netcup, Hetzner, DigitalOcean, etc.)
- Docker containers
- Other PaaS providers (Heroku, Fly.io, Render, etc.)

> *Windows is supported when `pg_dump` is installed and available in PATH.*

### Local Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- PostgreSQL client tools (`pg_dump`)
- pip

### Run Manually (Local)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

### Run with Docker (Optional)

Build and run the image locally:

```bash
docker build -t postgres-to-r2-backup .
docker run --env-file .env postgres-to-r2-backup
```

> Ensure the container is allowed to run continuously when not using an external cron scheduler.

> All scheduling uses **UTC** by default (e.g. Malaysia UTC+8 → set `BACKUP_TIME=16:00` for midnight).

### Run from Prebuilt Docker Image

If you downloaded a prebuilt Docker image archive (`.tar` or `.tar.gz`), you can run it without building locally:

```bash
# Extract the archive (if compressed)
tar -xzf postgres-to-r2-backup_v1.0.6.tar.gz

# Load the image into Docker
docker load -i postgres-to-r2-backup_v1.0.6.tar

# Run the container
docker run --env-file .env postgres-to-r2-backup:v1.0.6
```

> Prebuilt images are architecture-specific (amd64 / arm64).

## 🧰 Using the CLI (Global Installation)

This project can also be used as a standalone CLI tool, installable via pip, in addition to running as a Railway or Docker service.

### Install via pip

```bash
pip install pg-r2-backup
```

### Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- PostgreSQL client tools (`pg_dump`) installed and available in PATH

### Quick Start (CLI)

```bash
mkdir backups
cd backups

pg-r2-backup init      # creates .env from .env.example
pg-r2-backup doctor    # checks environment and dependencies
pg-r2-backup run       # runs a backup immediately
```

### CLI Commands

```bash
pg-r2-backup run            # Run backup immediately
pg-r2-backup doctor         # Check environment & dependencies
pg-r2-backup config show    # Show current configuration
pg-r2-backup init           # Create .env from .env.example
pg-r2-backup schedule       # Show scheduling examples
pg-r2-backup --version
```

### Environment Variable Resolution (CLI)

When running via the CLI, environment variables are resolved in the following order:

1. A `.env` file in the current working directory (or parent directory)
2. System environment variables

This allows different folders to maintain separate backup configurations.

### Local Backup Behavior (CLI)

By default, pg-r2-backup deletes the local backup file after a successful upload.

To keep a local copy (recommended for local machines, VPS, or NAS):

    KEEP_LOCAL_BACKUP=true

> Not recommended on PaaS platforms (Railway, Fly.io, Render, Heroku, etc.)
> due to ephemeral filesystems.

### Scheduling Backups (CLI)

The CLI does not run a background scheduler. Use your operating system or platform scheduler instead.

**Linux / macOS (cron)**

```bash
0 0 * * * pg-r2-backup run
```

**Windows (Task Scheduler)**

- Program: `pg-r2-backup`
- Arguments: `run`
- Start in: folder containing `.env` (working directory)

**Railway / Docker**

Use the platform's built-in scheduler (recommended).

💡 **Tip**  
Run `pg-r2-backup schedule` at any time to see scheduling examples.

## ❓ FAQ

**Why only DATABASE_URL?**  
This matches how most modern platforms expose PostgreSQL credentials.  
Support for separate DB variables may be added if there is demand.
